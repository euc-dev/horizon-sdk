## Introduction

This document provides Omnissa partners with step-by-step instructions on how to set up a Horizon environment for WebRTC Redirection of media streams in unified communication (UC) applications.

The Omnissa Horizon® SDK for WebRTC Redirection provides access to interfaces that WebRTC-based UC vendors can use to leverage the Media Optimization feature of Horizon Client and Horizon remote desktops. The SDK enables the offloading of audio, video, and screenshare content to the local client system.

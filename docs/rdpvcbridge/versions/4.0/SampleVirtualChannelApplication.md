# Sample Virtual Channel Application

The RDPVCBridge SDK contains a sample virtual channel application called `vchan-ping`. This application creates a virtual channel and sends a simple string using the virtual channel four times to the Client.

`vchan-ping` has a client-side component and an agent-side component. The client-side component runs on a client machine. The agent-side component runs in a Horizon virtual desktop machine.

The RDPVCBridge SDK includes the source code of `vchan-ping`, the solution file for building it on Windows, and a Makefile for building it on Linux.

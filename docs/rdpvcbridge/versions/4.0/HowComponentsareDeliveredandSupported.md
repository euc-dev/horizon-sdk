# How Components Are Delivered and Supported

The agent-side components are included with Horizon Agent. The client-side components are included with Horizon Client.

You must use the version of the `vdp_rdpvcbridge.dll` that is installed with Horizon Agent and Horizon Client to ensure compatibility with previous and future releases of Horizon.

The RDPVCBridge SDK is available free for download and can be used immediately.

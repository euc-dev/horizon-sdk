# Support Policy

The RDPVCBridge SDK is free, public, and unsupported. However, we do offer paid development consulting on request. Contact us at Horizon-View-RDPVCBridge-SDKSupport@omnissa.com for more information. 

Omnissa might periodically release bug fixes:
- Bugs in the client-side components are fixed as part of a Horizon Client release. 
- Bugs in the agent-side components are fixed as part of a Horizon release. 
- The RDPVCBridge SDK is updated when new features are added to the SDK.

The Horizon SDK for WebRTC Redirection includes a sample folder containing both a sample Electron application and a sample web application that shows examples of how to use the API. You can run the sample app on either your local machine or remote desktop.

The sample app itself does not contain any open source or third-party code. However, you must install certain NodeJS packages and perform some server setup tasks in order to run the app.
Follow the procedures in this chapter to set up the sample app.

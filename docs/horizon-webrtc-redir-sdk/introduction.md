# Introduction

Omnissa provides several software development kit (SDK) products, each of which targets different developer communities and platforms.

With the Omnissa HorizonÂ® SDK for WebRTC Redirection, you can enable media-optimized WebRTC Redirection for Electron applications that communicate between a client and a remote desktop over a Horizon connection using the Blast Extreme or PCoIP display protocol.

This SDK includes resources such as files, a sample Electron application, and documentation to help you develop applications that use the Omnissa Horizon WebRTC Redirection API.

## About this Programming Guide

This document provides information about how to enable WebRTC Redirection of media streams in unified communication (UC) applications using the Omnissa Horizon WebRTC Redirection Application Programming Interface (API).

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for software developers who want to enable WebRTC Redirection for UC applications used remotely over a Omnissa Horizon 8 or Omnissa Horizon Cloud Service on Microsoft Azure connection.

> **Note:** This SDK only supports Electron-based UC applications running on Omnissa VDI deployments. It does not support CEF, PWA, or browser-based WebRTC applications. To implement media optimization for browser-based WebRTC applications, use the [Browser Content Redirection feature](https://docs.omnissa.com/bundle/Horizon-Remote-Desktop-FeaturesVmulti/page/ConfiguringBrowserContentRedirection.html).

## How to Download
This SDK can be downloaded through [Github](https://github.com/euc-releases/horizon-webrtc-redir-sdk)

**Note:**
The GitHub link is the only valid and supported source. It is not recommended to download any packages from npmjs.com.

This section describes the steps to run the sample app included with the SDK.

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can build your own client app on the Electron framework, as described in the [Electron Quick Start Guide](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start#package-and-distribute-your-application).

## Steps to Run the App from the Client Machine

1. Ensure that you have NodeJS installed in your environment. Itâ€™s recommended that you install the latest stable version of NodeJS.
2. In `./client/serverInfo.json`, configure the index page URL for `pageUrl`. For example:
    ```json
    "pageUrl": "https://192.168.1.101/sample/index.html"
    ```
    In the example, `192.168.1.101` is the Web server address, and `sample` is the web application folder on the Web server where you copied the `index.html` file and the `sdk`, `common`, and `app` folders. Replace these example values with your own information.
3. In `./client/serverInfo.json`, configure the value of `callServerUrl`. For example:
    ```json
    "callServerUrl": "wss://192.168.1.200:8443"
    ```
    In the example, `192.168.1.200` is the Web Socket server address, and `8443` is the port number configured in `./server/wsServer.js`. Replace these example values with your own information.
4. To start the app, change to the `./client` directory and run `npm start`.

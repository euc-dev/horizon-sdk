# v2.SwitchToStreamDataMode

Switches vdpservice to TCP socket mode. This is an agent-only feature. In this mode, user can use output socket handle to send and receive data via a TCP socket handler. All internal vdpservice threads are terminated in order to save resources. Only `VDPRPC_StreamDataInterface` and `VDPService_ServerExit` APIs can be called for the data processing and final clean-up.

This function is a member of `VDPService_ChannelInterface`.


## Method Signature

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |

| fd | Output TCP socket handle. | 

## Return Values

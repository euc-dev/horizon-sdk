# v1.Poll

Allows the Horizon Session Enhancement system to process any waiting events. This call is required on any thread that the `v1.ThreadInitialize` call was made to so that the Horizon Session Enhancement system can function. If there are no waiting events, this call will just return.
 
**Note:** All waiting events will be processed, so control may not be returned to you for some time. Most events will cause calls to registered sinks. Callbacks might be fired.
 
On Windows, if the thread uses its own message loop, using the method is not required.

This function is a member of `VDPService_ChannelInterface`.

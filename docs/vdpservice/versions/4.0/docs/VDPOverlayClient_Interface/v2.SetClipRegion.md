# v2.SetClipRegion

Sets the clipping region on the overlay. This function cannot be called on guest-created overlays.

This function is a member of `VDPOverlayClient_Interface`.

## Method Signature
```
VDPOverlay_Error (*v2.SetClipRegion)(VDPOverlayClient_ContextId contextId, VDPOverlay_OverlayId overlayId, VMRect* pClipRects, int32 nClipRects);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| contextId | The ID returned from `VDPOverlayClient.v1.Init()`. |
| overlayId | An overlay ID that was returned from a previous call to `CreateOverlay()`. |
| pClipRects | An array of VMRect's that describe the visible area of the overlay. The clipping information is relative to the screen. For example, 0,0 is the top-left corner of the screen. This means that the clipping information describes a specific area of the screen that does not change when the overlay is moved. A copy of the VMRect array is made so that the caller does not have to maintain the memory. |
| nClipRects | The number of VMRects in the pClipRects array. Passing the value of 0 for nClipRects removes the clip region. |

## Return Values

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_SUCCESS | No error. The function was successful. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED	| Overlay API was not initialized. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER | The contextId or overlayId parameter was invalid, or pClipRects is NULL. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_NOT_LOCAL_OVERLAY | The overlayId of a guest-side overlay was passed to a function that can only be called on a local overlay. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_HOST_OVERLAY_ERROR | There is an error with a low-level library. This error code should be treated as similar to INVALID_PARAMETER. |

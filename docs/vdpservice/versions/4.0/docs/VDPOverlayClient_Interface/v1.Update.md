# v1.Update

Updates the overlay with a new image. The updated image is displayed when the next frame is drawn.

This function is a member of `VDPOverlayClient_Interface`.

## Method Signature
```
VDPOverlay_Error (*v1.Update)(VDPOverlayClient_ContextId contextId, VDPOverlay_WindowId windowId, void* pImage, int32 width, int32 height, int32 pitch, Bool copyImage);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| contextId | The ID returned from `VDPOverlayClient.v1.Init()`. |
| windowId | Window ID that was received from a previous `OnWindowRegistered()` event. |
| pImage | A pointer to the RGBX pixels to copy to the overlay. |
| width | Width, in pixels, of the image pointed to by pImage. If the width of the image does not match the width of the overlay, the given image is drawn according the layout mode of the overlay. |
| height | Height, in pixels, of the image pointed to by pImage. If the height of the image does not match the height of overlay, the given image is drawn according the layout mode of the overlay. |
| pitch | Number of bytes that a single row of the image occupies. In the normal case, for BGRX images, this value is width multiplied by 4. |
| copyImage | If `TRUE`, a copy of the image data is made. If `FALSE`, no copy is made and the image data must remain valid until another call to `VDPOverlayClient_Update()` is made. |

## Return Values

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_SUCCESS | Image was updated. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED	| Overlay API was not initialized. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER | The contextId, windowID, or pImage parameter was invalid. |

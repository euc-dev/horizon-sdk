# v2.SetColorkey

Sets the color key on a local overlay. This function cannot be called on guest-created overlays.
 
**Note:** The use of color keys is discouraged because they do not work well with the Blast protocol. To limit the area of the guest UI for rendering the overlay, use `v2.SetClipRegion` instead.

This function is a member of `VDPOverlayClient_Interface`.

## Method Signature
```
VDPOverlay_Error (*v2.SetColorkey)(VDPOverlayClient_ContextId contextId, VDPOverlay_OverlayId overlayId, uint32 colorkey);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| contextId | The ID returned from `VDPOverlayClient.v1.Init()`. |
| overlayId | An overlay ID that was returned from a previous call to `CreateOverlay()`. |
| colorkey | An RGB value that will limit the area of the guest UI where the overlay is drawn. When a color key is set on an overlay only the pixels on the guest's UI that match the color key value will be updated. It is the caller's responsibility to draw the color key to an area on the guest's desktop that corresponds to the position of the overlay as set by `SetPosition()`. Passing VDP_OVERLAY_COLORKEY_NONE will remove the color key from the overlay. |

## Return Values

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_SUCCESS | No error. The function was successful. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED	| Overlay API was not initialized. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER | The contextId, overlayId, or colorkey parameter was invalid. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_NOT_LOCAL_OVERLAY | The overlayId of a guest-side overlay was passed to a function that can only be called on a local overlay. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_HOST_OVERLAY_ERROR | There is an error with a low-level library. This error code should be treated as similar to INVALID_PARAMETER. |

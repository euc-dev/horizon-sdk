# `v5.GetRemoteWindowId`

Returns the remote desktop window ID associated with an overlay.

Guest side overlays are automatically associated with the remote window they are tracking. An error is returned when trying to change the remote window ID for a guest side overlay.

Client side local overlays have an associated remote window ID of 0 by default and can only be changed by calling v5.SetRemoteWindowId().

This function is a member of VDPOverlayClient_Interface.

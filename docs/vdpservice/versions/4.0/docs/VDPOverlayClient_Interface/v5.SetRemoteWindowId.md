# `v5.SetRemoteWindowId`

Associates a local overlay with a remote window.

Guest side overlays are automatically associated with the remote window they are tracking. An error is returned when trying to change the remote window ID for a guest side overlay.

Client side local overlays have an associated remote window ID of 0 by default.

When using the VDPScreenCapture ReadBackWindow function knowing which overlays are associated with a particular remote window is helpful in knowing which overlays to include and/or exclude in the image returned.

Only overlays with a matching remote window ID are eligible to be included in the image returned from ReadBackWindow() according to the VDPScreenCapture_OverlayOptions parameter.

Overlays with a non-matching remote window ID are always excluded from the image returned by ReadBackWindow().

This function is a member of VDPOverlayClient_Interface.

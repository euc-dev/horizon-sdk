# `v1.GetRemoteTopology`
Retrieves the topology of the remote desktop.
This function is a member of VDPScreenCapture_Interface.

### Method Signature
```
VDPScreenCapture_Error (*v1.GetRemoteTopology)(
    VDPScreenCapture_ContextId contextId,
    VDPScreenCapture_Rect* pBounds,
    int32* pszTopology,
    VDPScreenCapture_Rect* pTopology
);
```

### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| contextId | The ID returned from VDPScreenCapture.v1.Init(). |
| pBounds | Returns a rectangle which contains the bounding box for the entire remote desktop. Pass NULL to avoid returning the information. |
| pszTopology | A pointer to an int32. On input the value is the size of the pTopology array which will return the remote desktop topology. On output the value is the number of rectangles required to hold the entire remote desktop topology; which may be larger than the size passed in if the pTopology array is too small to hold the entire topology. Passing NULL is treated the same as *pszTopology == 0. |
| pTopology | A pointer to an array which returns the rectangles that make up the remote desktop topology. Can be NULL only if pszTopology is NULL or *pszTopology == 0. |

### Return Values
| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| VDP_SCREEN_CAPTURE_ERROR_SUCCESS | The topology information was returned. |
| VDP_SCREEN_CAPTURE_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER | contextId is invalid, szTopology is < 0 or pTopology was NULL when szTopology > 0. |
| VDP_SCREEN_CAPTURE_ERROR_NOT_ALLOWED_IN_APP_MODE | This function can not be called when the Horizon client is in application mode. |

# `v4.ReadBackRequestUpdate`
Provides an image to include in a read back image. While this function can be called at any time, it is normally called during the v4.OnReadBackRequest() callback to provide an image. A copy of the image is made and is used in all further read back requests until the image is either replaced or removed by the next call to v4.ReadBackRequestUpdate().
This function is a member of VDPScreenCapture_Interface.

    VDPScreenCapture_ContextId contextId,

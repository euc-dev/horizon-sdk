To interact with and receive notifications of changes, you must register sinks with the Horizon Session Enhancement APIs. Channel sinks are common sinks.

These functions are members of `VDPService_ChannelNotifySink`.

- [`v1.OnChannelStateChanged`](v1.OnChannelStateChanged.md)
- [`v1.OnConnectionStateChanged`](v1.OnConnectionStateChanged.md)
- [`v1.OnPeerObjectCreated`](v1.OnPeerObjectCreated.md)

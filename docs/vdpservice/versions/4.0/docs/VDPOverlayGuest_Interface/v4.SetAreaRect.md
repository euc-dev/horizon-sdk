# v4.SetAreaRect

Sets the area of the window for displaying the overlay. Same as `v3.SetAreaRect()`, but with additional parameters for turning on and off the rectangle area and for clipping the rectangle area to the window.

This function is a member of `VDPOverlayGuest_Interface`.

## Clipping Behavior

The clipToWindow parameter determines if the given area rectangle is clipped to the window.

**Note:** The image displayed in the overlay is always clipped to the window.

When this parameter is `TRUE`, the given area rectangle is clipped to the window before the layout mode is applied, such that the image is scaled down to fit inside the clipped area rectangle.

When this parameter is `FALSE`, the layout mode is applied first and then the image is clipped to the window. In this case, the image doesn't shrink when the bounds of the area rectangle extend past the bounds of the window, but less of the image is shown.

## Method Signature
```
VDPOverlay_Error (*v4.SetAreaRect)(VDPOverlay_WindowId windowId, Bool enabled, Bool clipToWindow, VDPOverlay_Rect* pRect);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| windowId | The operating system window identifier of the overlay. It must have been previously registered with `VDPOverlayGuest_RegisterWindow()`. |
| enabled | Determines when the area rectangle is enabled. If `TRUE`, the overlay is constrained to the given rectangle. If `FALSE`, the overlay will be displayed in the entire area of the window. |
| clipToWindow | Determines if the given area rectangle is clipped to the window. For more details, see the "Clipping Behavior" section earlier on this page. |
| pRect | A pointer to a VDPOverlay_Rect which defines the area of the window for displaying the overlay. Passing NULL removes the constraining area and displays the image in the entire area of the window. |

## Return Values

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_SUCCESS | The function was successful. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED	| Overlay API was not initialized. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER | One of the parameter entries was invalid. |
| VDP_OVERLAY_ERROR_WINDOW_NOT_REGISTERED | The given windowId has not been registered with the Overlay API. |

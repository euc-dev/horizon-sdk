# v3.RegisterWindow

Registers a window to be overlayed. The position, size, and so on, of the window are sent to the client so that a client-side plug-in can draw an area of the desktop UI that covers the window, giving the illusion that the drawing is happening on the guest side.

This function performs the same operations as `v1.RegisterWindow()` but supports additional options.

- A window can be registered multiple times, allowing you to use different areas of the window to display the overlay image. Use `SetAreaRect()` to define the area within the window for displaying the overlay image.

- The first parameter is a VDPOverlay_HWND instead of a VDPOverlay_WindowId. The size of a VDPOverlay_WindowId is 32 bits but on 64-bit Windows an HWND is 64 bits. The parameter VDPOverlay_HWND, which is defined as an HWND, removes the need to cast the HWND to a VDPOverlay_WindowId. This solution guarantees that bits are not lost when casting.

This function is a member of `VDPOverlayGuest_Interface`.

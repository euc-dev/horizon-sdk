# v4.SetBackgroundColor

Sets the background color to use when painting the area of the window that the overlay covers. This color is visible in the area of the overlay that the image does not cover, for example, the borders of the image when the layout mode is VDP_OVERLAY_LAYOUT_LETTERBOX. The background color is also visible if the image has an alpha channel.

This function is a member of `VDPOverlayGuest_Interface`.

## Method Signature
```
VDPOverlay_Error (*v4.SetBackgroundColor)(VDPOverlay_WindowId windowId, uint32 bgColor);
```

## Parameters

# v1.GetStreamDataHeaderTailSize

Fetches the size of the header and the tail for stream data mode (TCP socket) if neither compression nor encryption is needed. Because stream data mode is an agent-only feature, data needs to be encapsulated in RPC format to the client. This API is used to calculate the size of the header and the tail.

This function is a member of `VDPRPC_StreamDataInterface`.

## Method Signature
```
Bool (*v1.GetStreamDataHeaderTailSize)(int fd, int dataSize, int *headerLen, int *tailLen);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| fd | A valid socket handle returned by `v2.SwitchToStreamDataMode`. |
| dataSize | The size of the data that the client intends to send. |
| headerLen | The size of the header is returned here. |
| tailLen | The size of the tail is returned here. |

## Return Values

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| TRUE | Successfully fetched the sizes. |
| FALSE | Failure. Socket handle may be invalid. |

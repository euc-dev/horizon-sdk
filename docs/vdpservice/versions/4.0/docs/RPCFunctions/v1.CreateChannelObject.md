# v1.CreateChannelObject

Creates a channel object with the given name. This call, with the same object name, must be made on both the plug-in and the application for communication to occur.

Objects begin in the VDP_RPC_OBJ_PENDING state. After the peer object is created, which might be prior to the call, the state goes to VDP_RPC_OBJ_CONNECTED. The sink registered with the object receives notifications of events involving the new object. A handle for the created object is returned in the objectHandle parameter.
 
**Note:** Objects must be used on the thread on which they are created, unless configured with the VDP_RPC_OBJ_CONFIG_INVOKE_ALLOW_ANY_THREAD flag. If this option is used, the user is responsible for thread safety.
 
This function is a member of `VDPRPC_ChannelObjectInterface`.

# v1.SetCommand

Sets the command code for the given context. The command code represents the remote method that the context is meant to represent.
 
**Note:** You can also store the command as a string using `SetNamedCommand`. However, you can only use one method. If you call `SetNamedCommand` after calling `SetCommand`, the uint32 command code is overwritten. Do not use 0 as the command code because the Horizon Session Enhancement system uses 0 to indicate an error.
 
This function is a member of `VDPRPC_ChannelContextInterface`.

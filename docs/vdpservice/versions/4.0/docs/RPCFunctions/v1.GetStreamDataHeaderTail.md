Fetches the header and tail data for stream data mode to send via the TCP socket. This function is mainly for optimization by eliminating a memcpy.

This function is a member of `VDPRPC_StreamDataInterface`.

## Method Signature
```
Bool (*v1.GetStreamDataHeaderTail)(int fd, int *reqId, int reqCmd, VDP_RPC_BLOB *blob, char *header, int headerBufLen, char *tail, int tailBufLen);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| fd | A valid socket handle returned by `v2.SwitchToStreamDataMode`. |
| reqId | RPC request ID is returned here for the caller to track each request. |
| reqCmd | Request command. |
| blob | Blob data which will be sent using the TCP socket. |
| header | Buffer to hold header data. |
| headerBufSize | Header buffer size. Must be greater than or equal to the size returned by `v1.GetStreamDataHeaderTailSize`. |
| tail | Buffer to hold tail data. |
| tailBufLen | Tail buffer size. Must be greater than or equal to the size returned by `v1.GetStreamDataHeaderTailSize`. |

## Return Values

| Value | Description |

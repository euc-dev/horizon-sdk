# v2.CreateContext

Same as `v1.CreateContext` but supports compression and encryption options.
 
This function is a member of `VDPRPC_ChannelObjectInterface`.


## Method Signature
```
Bool (*v3.CreateContext)(void *objectHandle, uint32 options, void **ppcontextHandle);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| objectHandle | A handle for a valid channel object. |
| options | Specifies whether compression and encryption will apply for this context. For details about available options, see the next section. |
| ppcontextHandle | A handle for the new channel context is returned here. |

## Compression and Encryption Options

You can combine the uint32 values using the bitwise OR operator " | ". However, you can select only one encryption option and one compression option. To get the values supported by the current channel, use `v3.GetObjectOptions`.

The following available encryption options are supported on the TCP side channel only. Other side channel types transfer data over the main channel, which is already encrypted and secured by the remote protocol.
- VDP_RPC_CRYPTO_AES 
- VDP_RPC_CRYPTO_SALSA

The following available compression options are supported on the main channel and all side channels.
- VDP_RPC_COMP_SNAPPY 
- VDP_RPC_COMP_ZLIB 
- VDP_RPC_COMP_MSFT

## Return Values

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| TRUE | The new context was successfully created and returned. |
| FALSE | Context creation failed. |

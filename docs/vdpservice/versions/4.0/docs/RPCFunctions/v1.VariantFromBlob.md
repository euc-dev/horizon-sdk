# v1.VariantFromBlob

Stores a copy of the given VDP_RPC_BLOB in the given variant. Use this method only for data that does not fit any of the other types. Data is sent as-is, so changes in architecture (such as sending from a Linux client to a Windows guest) and differences in structure padding and alignment can cause problems with your data.

This function is a member of `VDPRPC_VariantInterface`.

# About This Guide

This programming guide provides information about developing applications using the Omnissa HorizonÂ® Session Enhancement Application Programming Interface (API), version 4.0. Omnissa provides several software development kit (SDK) products, each of which targets different developer communities and platforms.

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for software developers who want to create applications that are used remotely over connections to a Omnissa Horizon 7, Omnissa Horizon 8, or Omnissa Horizon Cloud Service deployments.

**NOTE**: Within this document, file paths, registry keys, and similar code-related items are revised to reflect the SDK's use with the Omnissa stack. References to items that were for Horizon versions 2406 and earlier versions contain asterisks (***) to redact the previous name.
